# Physics HALO
*A weekend full of physics brought to you by the Society of Physics Students at UT Dallas*

This workshop will be a jump start in Python 3 programming for students interested in applying it to scientific projects. Part 1 of the workshop will introduce Python 3 basics, including data structures, loops, and user-defined functions. Part 2 will be dedicated to guided examples using common Python 3 packages.

## What's In this Repository
* **files** contains 3 data files you will use during Part 2
* **Getting Started.pdf** contains detailed perparation instructions for this workshop
* **README.md** is the file that creates this description
* **Part-1** contains the Python notebooks for the first lesson
* **Part-2** contains the Python notebooks for the second lesson 

## Getting Started: 
See [**Getting-Started.pdf**](https://github.com/vcatlett/Physics-HALO/blob/main/Getting-Started.pdf) for a thorough description of how to prepare for this workshop. Here is a summary:
* Install Jupyter Notebook, which is a part of the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Make sure that you have or download the Python 3.8 version. 
* Install the packages listed below 
* Download the files in this repository to your computer. To do so, click the green "Clone or Download" button above and select "Download ZIP." You will need to **unzip** the download before you can open the files on your computer. 

### Packages
You will need each of the following Python packages:
* Numpy
* SciPy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Astropy

To download each of the package, go to the **Command Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (Mac). Then, type ```pip install package_name``` (where the package name is all lowercase) and press ```enter```.

For example, to download NumPy, use ```pip install numpy```.
