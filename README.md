# REU Summer Workshop: Python 3
*A [virtual workshop](https://sites.google.com/aps.org/reu-summer-workshop-python-3/home) brought to you by the American Physical Society*

This workshop will be a jump start in Python 3 programming for students interested in applying it to scientific projects. The first half of the workshop will introduce Python 3 basics, including data structures, loops, and user-defined functions. The second half will be dedicated to guided examples using common Python 3 packages.

## Getting Started: 
See [**Getting Started.pdf**](https://github.com/vcatlett/APS-Python-Workshop/blob/master/Getting%20Started.pdf) for a thorough description of how to prepare for this workshop. Here is a summary:
* Install Jupyter Notebook, which is a part of the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Make sure that you have or download the Python 3.7 version. 
(This workshop will be conducted with Jupyter Notebook. However, if you are already familiar with Python, you may use the IDE of your choice.)
* Install the packages listed below 
* Download the files in this repository to your computer. To do so, click the green "Clone or Download" button above and select "Download ZIP." You will need to **unzip** the download before you can open the files on your computer. 

### Packages
You will need each of the following Python packages:
* Numpy
* SciPy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Astropy

To download each of the package, go to the **Command Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (Mac). Then, type ```pip install package_name``` (where the package name is all lowercase) and press ```enter```.

For example, to download NumPy, use ```pip install numpy```.
